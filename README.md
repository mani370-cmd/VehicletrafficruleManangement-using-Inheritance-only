# VehicletrafficruleManangement-using-Inheritance-only
This project is a simple Vehicle Traffic Rules Management System developed using C# to practice the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming. It includes a base class Vehicle and derived classes like Vehicles, Trafficsignal, and fine government issued, each representing different vehicle types that follow basic traffic rules. The purpose of this project is to understand how inheritance works in real-world scenarios by organizing common and specific properties in a structured way. As an aspiring .NET Full Stack Developer, this is my first step toward learning core programming concepts, and today I focused on C# inheritance by building this project. This hands-on learning experience marks the beginning of my software developmentÂ journey.
